# Predicting-Google-Stock-Price-Movements-Comparing-Raw-Data-and-Feature-Extraction-Approaches-with-R
In this project we aim to predict the movement directions of Google's stock prices using historical data from 2010 to 2021. The methodology employed involves two approaches: one using raw data and another using feature extraction. Both approaches utilize the Random Forest ensemble method for classification and optimization.
