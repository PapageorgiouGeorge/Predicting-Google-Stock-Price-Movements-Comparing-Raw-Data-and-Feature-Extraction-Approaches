# Predicting-Google-Stock-Price-Movements-Comparing-Raw-Data-and-Feature-Extraction-Approaches-with-Ranfom-Forest-Classification

In this project we aim to predict the movement directions of Google's stock prices using historical data from 2010 to 2021. The methodology employed involves two approaches: one using raw data and another using feature extraction. Both approaches utilize the Random Forest ensemble method for classification and optimization.

The findings show that the model using raw data achieved a 67.5% accuracy, while the model using feature extraction achieved a 72.5% accuracy. The latter model's improved performance was evident in the ROC AUC metric as well. In conclusion, the project demonstrates that feature extraction is the best choice for optimizing stock market movement direction predictions, with William's Percentage Range and Stochastic Oscillator being the most influential features.
